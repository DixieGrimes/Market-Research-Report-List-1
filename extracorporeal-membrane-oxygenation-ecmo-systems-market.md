<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA (Veno-Arterial) ECMO</li><li>VV (Veno-Venous) ECMO</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) systems consist of two primary types: Veno-Arterial (VA) and Veno-Venous (VV) ECMO. VA ECMO circulates blood from a venous access point to an arterial return, supporting both heart and lung function, typically used in cases of cardiac failure. In contrast, VV ECMO removes blood from a vein and returns it to another vein, primarily assisting lung function in patients with severe respiratory failure. Both systems are crucial in critical care settings for temporary cardiopulmonary support.</p></p>
