<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autologous Transplant</li><li>Allogenic Transplant</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hematopoietic Stem Cells Transplantation (HSCT) primarily comprises two market types: autologous and allogenic transplants. Autologous transplants involve transferring a patientâ€™s own stem cells, typically harvested before intensive treatment, minimizing the risk of rejection and infection. In contrast, allogenic transplants utilize stem cells from a compatible donor, which can be necessary for patients without sufficient healthy cells. Both methods serve critical roles in treating various blood disorders, including leukemia and lymphoma, influencing their market dynamics and growth potential.</p></p>
