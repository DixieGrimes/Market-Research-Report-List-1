<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Blood Glucose Test Strips Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glucose Oxidase</li><li>Glucose Dehydrogenase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The blood glucose test strips market primarily features two types: glucose oxidase and glucose dehydrogenase. Glucose oxidase strips utilize an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of glucose, producing a measurable electric current related to glucose concentration. In contrast, glucose dehydrogenase strips use a different enzymatic reaction, also creating a measurable signal but often with fewer interferences from other sugars. Both types are crucial for diabetes management, offering patients reliable methods for monitoring their blood glucose levels.</p></p>
