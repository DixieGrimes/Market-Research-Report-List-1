<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Granular Phytases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Acid Phytase</li><li>Alkaline Phytase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The granular phytases market is categorized into two main types: acid phytase and alkaline phytase. Acid phytase is effective in breaking down phytic acid in acidic environments, commonly aiding livestock in nutrient absorption in their diets. Alkaline phytase, on the other hand, functions optimally in neutral to alkaline conditions, enhancing phosphorus availability in feed formulations, especially for ruminants. Both types play crucial roles in improving feed efficiency, promoting growth, and reducing environmental phosphorus pollution in agricultural practices.</p></p>
