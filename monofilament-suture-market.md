<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Monofilament Suture Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Monofilament Suture</li><li>Non-absorbable Monofilament Suture</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The monofilament suture market is divided into two main types: absorbable and non-absorbable monofilament sutures. Absorbable monofilament sutures are designed to gradually break down in the body, making them ideal for internal tissues where permanent support isn't necessary. Non-absorbable monofilament sutures, on the other hand, maintain their integrity over time and are used for applications requiring long-term tensile strength, such as in skin closure or certain orthopedic procedures. Both types play crucial roles in surgical practices.</p></p>
