<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Pushback Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional/Towbars Pushback Tugs</li><li>Towbarless Pushback Tugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft pushback tugs market is primarily divided into two types: conventional/towbar pushback tugs and towbarless pushback tugs. Conventional pushback tugs utilize a towbar to connect with the aircraft's nose gear, allowing for effective maneuvering and control during pushback operations. In contrast, towbarless pushback tugs connect directly to the aircraft, facilitating quicker and more efficient movements without the need for an additional towbar, enhancing operational flexibility in busy airport environments. Both types are crucial for ensuring safe and efficient aircraft ground handling.</p></p>
