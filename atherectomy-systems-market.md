<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Atherectomy Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Directional Atherectomy</li><li>Orbital Atherectomy</li><li>Photo-Ablative (Laser) Atherectomy</li><li>Rotational Atherectomy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Atherectomy systems are medical devices used to remove plaque from blood vessels. Directional atherectomy directs a cutting blade to remove tissue, while orbital atherectomy uses a rotating device to grind plaque away. Photo-ablative (laser) atherectomy employs laser energy to vaporize plaque, offering precision and minimal vessel trauma. Rotational atherectomy utilizes a high-speed rotating burr, effectively abating calcified lesions. Each type addresses different plaque characteristics, enhancing patient outcomes through tailored interventional approaches in cardiovascular procedures.</p></p>
