<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rocket Engine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Rocket Engine</li><li>Solid Rocket Engine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rocket engine market is primarily divided into two main types: liquid rocket engines and solid rocket engines. Liquid rocket engines utilize propellants stored in separate tanks, allowing for adjustable thrust and multiple ignitions, making them ideal for space missions requiring precise control. In contrast, solid rocket engines consist of preloaded propellant within a casing, offering straightforward design and high thrust but limited control once ignited. Both types play critical roles in space exploration, defense, and satellite deployment.</p></p>
