<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three compartment Knee Prosthesis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cemented Bone</li><li>Non-Cemented Bone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The three-compartment knee prosthesis market is divided into cemented and non-cemented categories. Cemented bone prostheses utilize a polymer-based cement to fix the implant securely, promoting immediate stability and early postoperative mobilization. Non-cemented bone prostheses, on the other hand, rely on biological fixation through bone growth into the implant surface, offering a more natural long-term integration but requiring longer recovery times for stability. Both types cater to different patient needs and orthopedic surgeon preferences based on individual conditions.</p></p>
