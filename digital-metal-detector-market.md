<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Metal Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Very Low Frequency</li><li>Pulse Induction</li><li>Beat-frequency Oscillation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Digital Metal Detector market is segmented into three key types: Very Low Frequency (VLF), Pulse Induction (PI), and Beat-frequency Oscillation (BFO). VLF detectors use two coils to create a magnetic field, allowing for the detection of small metal objects, making them popular for treasure hunting. PI detectors send short bursts of current, enabling deeper penetration and better performance in mineralized or wet soils. BFO detectors operate using two oscillators, offering a simpler design but with limited depth detection capabilities.</p></p>
