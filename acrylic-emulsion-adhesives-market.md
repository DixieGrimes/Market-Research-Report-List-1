<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Acrylic Emulsion Adhesives Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Volatile Curing</li><li>Water Curing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Acrylic emulsion adhesives are categorized into two primary types based on their curing mechanisms: volatile curing and water curing. Volatile curing adhesives utilize solvents that evaporate during the drying process, promoting bond strength as the adhesive solidifies. In contrast, water curing adhesives rely on moisture for curing, allowing for a more environmentally friendly option with lower VOC emissions. Both types are widely used in various applications, including packaging, woodworking, and construction, due to their excellent adhesion and versatility.</p></p>
