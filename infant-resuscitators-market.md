<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infant Resuscitators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-inflating Resuscitator</li><li>Flow-inflating Resuscitator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The infant resuscitator market includes two primary types: self-inflating resuscitators and flow-inflating resuscitators. Self-inflating resuscitators are portable devices that automatically refill with air or oxygen after each squeeze, facilitating quick emergency ventilation without the need for an external gas source. In contrast, flow-inflating resuscitators require a pressurized gas supply to inflate the bag, allowing for greater control of the volume and pressure delivered during resuscitation. Both types are crucial for providing effective neonatal care in critical situations.</p></p>
