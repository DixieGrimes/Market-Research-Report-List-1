<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agriculture Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agriculture tires market comprises two primary types: radial and bias (crossply) tires. Radial agriculture tires feature a tread that runs perpendicular to the tire's direction, offering better fuel efficiency, improved traction, and reduced vibration. They are ideal for high-powered machinery and offer longer lifespan. In contrast, bias tires are constructed with crossed plies, providing greater robustness and flexibility, making them suitable for rugged terrains. However, they typically exhibit less traction efficiency and shorter service life compared to radial tires.</p></p>
