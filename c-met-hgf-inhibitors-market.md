<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The C-MET / HGF Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>C-Met Biologic Inhibitors</li><li>Small Molecule C-Met Inhibitors</li><li>HGF Antagonist Antibodies</li><li>C-Met Antagonist Antibodies(MetMAb)</li><li>HGF Kringle Variant Antagonists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The C-MET/HGF inhibitors market includes various types targeting the C-MET pathway. C-MET biologic inhibitors are engineered proteins that block C-MET activity, while small molecule C-MET inhibitors are synthetic compounds that disrupt the receptor's function. HGF antagonist antibodies target hepatocyte growth factor to prevent activation of C-MET. C-MET antagonist antibodies, like MetMAb, directly inhibit C-MET signaling. Additionally, HGF kringle variant antagonists selectively bind to HGF, preventing its interaction with C-MET, thus inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis.</p></p>
