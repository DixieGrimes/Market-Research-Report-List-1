<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neutral density Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-Reflective Type</li><li>Reflective Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neutral density (ND) filters are essential tools in photography and cinematography, available in two main market types: non-reflective and reflective. Non-reflective ND filters, made from optical glass or resin, absorb light evenly across wavelengths, allowing for precise control of exposure without color distortion. Reflective ND filters, often made from coated glass, reduce light by reflecting it away, which can introduce some color shifts. Both types serve to help photographers and videographers manage light intensity while enhancing creative possibilities.</p></p>
