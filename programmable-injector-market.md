<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Programmable Injector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Split</li><li>Splitless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The programmable injector market features two main types: split and splitless. Split injectors allow a portion of the sample to enter the chromatographic system while venting the rest, optimizing sensitivity for concentrated samples. Conversely, splitless injectors direct the entire sample into the system, enhancing detection for trace components. The choice between these types depends on the analytical needs, with split injectors commonly used for higher concentration samples and splitless injectors for low concentration or trace analysis.</p></p>
